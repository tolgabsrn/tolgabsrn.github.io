            <li><b>'Forever, Michael' (1975</b>)</li>
            <p>This fourth solo album for Michael was his last with Motown records.</p>
            <li><b>'Off the Wall' (1979)</b></li>
            <p>An infectious blend of pop and funk, Michael wowed the music world with 1979’s Off the Wall, which featured the Grammy 
               Award-winning single "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough," along with such hits as "Rock with You," "She's Out of My Life" 
               and the title track.</p>
            <li><b>'Thriller' (1982)</b></li>
            <p>Released in 1982, Michael Jackson’s sixth solo album Thriller is the best-selling album in history, generating seven 
               Top 10 hits. The album stayed on the charts for 80 weeks, holding the No. 1 spot for 37 weeks. In addition to its

            <li><b>We Are the World' (single, 1985)</b></li>
            <p>In 1985, Jackson showed his altruistic side by co-writing "We Are the World," a charity single for USA for Africa. 
               A veritable who's who of music stars participated in the project, including Lionel Richie, Ray Charles, Bob Dylan, 
               Willie Nelson, Bruce Springsteen and Tina Turner.</p>
            <li><b>'Bad' (1987)</b></li>
            <p>Michael Jackson’s album Bad (1987), released as a follow-up to Thriller, reached the top of the charts, with a 
               record five No. 1 hits, including "Man in the Mirror," "The Way You Make Me Feel" and the title track, which was 
               supported by a video directed by Martin Scorsese. Jackson spent more than a year on the road, playing concerts to 
               promote the album. While highly successful, Bad was unable to duplicate the phenomenal sales of Thriller.</p>
            <li><b>'Dangerous' (1991)</b></li>
            <p>In 1991, Jackson released Dangerous, featuring the hit "Black or White." The video for this song, directed by Landis, 
                included an appearance by child star Macaulay Culkin. In the video's final minutes, Jackson caused some controversy 
                with his sexual gesturing and violent actions. Many were surprised to see the Peter Pan-like Jackson act in this manner. 
                Jackson's music continued to enjoy widespread popularity in the following years. In 1993, he performed at several 
                important events, including the halftime show of Superbowl XXVII.</p>
            <li><b>'HIStory: Past, Present, and Future, Book I'</b></li>
            <p>Jackson's musical career began to decline with the lukewarm reception to 1995's HIStory: Past, Present, and Future, 
                Book I, which featured some of his earlier hits as well as new material. The record spawned two hits, 
                "You Are Not Alone" and his duet with sister Janet Jackson, "Scream." The spaceship-themed video for "Scream," 
                which cost a record-setting $7 million to produce, earned a Grammy Award for its slick effects.</p>
            <li><b>'Michael' (2010)</b></li>
            <p>In December 2010, the posthumous album Michael was released amid controversy about whether the singer actually 
                performed some of the tracks. Brother Randy was among those who questioned the authenticity of the recordings, 
                but the Jackson estate later refuted the claims, according to The New York Times.</p>
            <li><b>'Xscape' (2014)</b></li>
            <p>Another posthumous album, Xscape, was released in May 2014. R&B star and Jackson protege Usher performed its first single,
                "Love Never Felt So Good," that month at the iHeartRadio Music Awards. The album, which includes eight songs recorded by 
                Jackson between 1983 and 1999, debuted at No. 2 on Billboard's Top 200 Album chart.
